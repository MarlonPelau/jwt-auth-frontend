There should be no surprise at this point if you know me, that my solo project idea has something to do with music, a common theme throughout.
My `Streamism` app allows users to browse, click around, take in my expert reviews and navigate to outside music streaming sites. But, if a user deccides to register and create a login/password, one can add to the increasingly competitive ecosystem of music streaming platforms, by reviewing and rating their experiences. Even though there are nine (9) music streaming services provided on my app and they've been critiqued with clarity, vetted and give excellent direction on its uniqueness, pros or cons and specific recommendations, a `streamer` will in many cases have other platforms that they've used. Empowering the streamer to share and compare their experiences here on my app, adds richness to the community, increases an awareness of user-expertise, and embodies the 'each one, teach one' philosophy.

### Features
-My `landing page` has an `About` and a `Login` links (top right) in the `Header/Navbar` that, if clicked, connects the user to my GitHub and a lil' `fun fact` blurb about me.

-`Streamism` captures nine (9) music streaming platforms, where the streamer can navigate even if not logged in, though limited by not being able to add any review to the respective music streaming services. The registered streamer of course, has all the C.R.U.D. options -- to create, read, update and delete, their reviews per music streaming service.

## User Personas:

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dgifdj6nx/image/upload/t_Gradient fade/v1712883985/Henri2_xxlt1t.avif" alt="Henri!" width="300" height="300">

1. Meet `Henri`, **Henri** loves to discover new music because not only is he an avid music lover of many genres, he commutes by train or sometimes by car, between his home in the suburbs and his job in the city, quite a distance away. To make the time go by faster, he enjoys seamless music streaming on his favorite app platforms, and is always open to different formats, as long as it flows with less talk and more and more new music. He's a creature of habit, so usually sticks to just two music platforms. My app would be perfect for him see his other options to explore, but at the same time, know exactly what he's getting into.


<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dgifdj6nx/image/upload/t_Gradient fade/v1712884349/Luanne_bxfrvw.avif" alt="Luanne!" width="300" height="300">

2. Meet `Luanne` -- **Luanne** doesn't really know what she wants, music-wise. But she's very sure on what she does NOT want to hear included in her gym workouts, walks in the park and on a weekend cooking or running errands. In other words, she's always on-the-go! And it's any genre or playlist of music that includes misogyny of women, vulgar language, or anything too aggressive! She doesn't mind very politically forward, liberal and progressive music, or podcasts though. She is also looking forward to 4/20 for obvious reasons, so her listening experience by the time that day hits, needs to be on-point.

At times, buried in code, with large chunks of time during class and at night, my Trello board `To-Do, Doing, Done` became a necessity to keep focus on tasks and realistic goals. It detailed lists and acted as a key reminder throughout each day of where I'm at in my progress.


### Visual Examples
